## Youtube_is_Chicken

> **Component**: YouTube Mobile Web (m.youtube.com)  
> **Browser**: Chrome Mobile (137.0.7151.72) (Android 15) Use your phone or tablet whatever you want

## 🔍 Summary
Refreshing the mobile web page during a pre-roll ad allows any viewer to **bypass ad playback** and watch the selected video instantly. The flaw is trivial to reproduce and script, leading to measurable revenue loss for creators and the platform.

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce
1. Open **Chrome Mobile** (not the native YouTube app!!). Use your phone or tablet whatever you want
2. Navigate to `https://youtube.com` and select a monetized video.  
3. When the pre-roll ad starts:  
   - Pull-to-refresh (just swipe down) **or** tap the ⟳ reload icon.  
4. No ad at all

> **Expected:** Ad should restart or block video until completion.  
> **Actual:** Ad is skipped, video begins immediately.

## 🎯 Impact
| Actor                  | Gain                  | Risk                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Any end-user           | Ad-free viewing yummy | Minimal effort, repeatable        |
| Botnet / script        | Mass ad-evasion       | Scalable fraud, CPM revenue bleed |
| Advertisers / Creators | —                     | Lost impressions & income         |

## 🖥️ Environment
```text
OS      : Android 15  
Browser : Chrome Mobile (137.0.7151.72)  
Site    : https://youtube.com (mobile web, not the app)  
````



## 💡 (possible) Root-Cause Hypothesis

The client-side ad player marks the “ad-completed” flag **before** the server confirms delivery. A full document reload clears the ad slot but preserves the playback pointer from the `?v=` URL, so the main video queues instantly.
